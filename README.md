**The future of secure cross-chain file transfer is here.**

We've created the world's first zero-knowledge proof-based file transfer system operating seamlessly across multiple blockchain networks, including Ethereum, Solana, and Sui.

Privacy isn't just a feature—it's our foundation. Through state-of-the-art zero-knowledge cryptography, Arweave for decentralized storage, and Wormhole for cross-chain interoperability, we're setting new standards for secure, private file transfers in a trustless environment.

Our achievements speak for themselves:

- Movement Labs Battle of Olympus Hackathon (Finalist🏆) | Oct 2024
- Encode Wormhole Global Hackathon Best Integration on an Existing Project (Winner🥉) | Oct 2024
- Wormhole xGrant (Project Grant) | Jun 2024
- Superteam Solana Grant (Project Grant) Jun 2024
- Sui Overflow Local Track (Winner🥇) | May 2024
- EDCON Japan (Finalist🏆) | May 2024
- Solana Global Renaissance Hackathon Multichain Track (Winner🥇) | April 2024
- Solana Demoday (Winner🥈) | March 2024
- Solana Mini Hackathon (Winner🥇) | March 2024
- Multiple blockchain network support
- Enterprise-ready solution

Launching Q1 2025 with support for:

- Cross-chain file transfers with zero-knowledge proofs
- Decentralized identity management
- Enterprise-grade security
- Seamless multi-chain compatibility
